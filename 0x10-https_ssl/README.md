HTTPS SSL
This project contains tasks for learning about how to setup HTTPS for a server (HAProxy).

Tasks To Complete
 0. World wide web
0-world_wide_web contains a Bash script that displays information about subdomains.

Requirements:
Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier.
Add the subdomain www to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP (your domain name might be configured with default subdomains, feel free to remove them).
Add the subdomain lb-01 to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP.
Add the subdomain web-01 to your domain, point it to your web-01 IP.
Add the subdomain web-02 to your domain, point it to your web-02 IP.
Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:.
domain:
Type: string.
What: domain name to audit.
Mandatory: yes.
subdomain:
Type: string.
What: specific subdomain to audit.
Mandatory: no.
Output: The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION].
When only the parameter domain is provided, display information for its subdomains www, lb-01, web-01 and web-02 - in this specific order.
When passing domain and subdomain parameters, display information for the specified subdomain.
Ignore shellcheck case SC2086 if you need to.
Must use awk and at least one Bash function.
You do not need to handle edge cases such as:
Empty parameters.
Nonexistent domain names.
Nonexistent subdomains.
 1. HAproxy SSL termination
1-haproxy_ssl_termination contains a HAproxy configuration file.

Info:
"Terminating SSL on HAproxy" means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.
Requirements:
Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..
HAproxy must be listening on port TCP 443.
HAproxy must be accepting SSL traffic.
HAproxy must serve encrypted traffic that will return the / of your web server.
When querying the root of your domain name, the page returned must contain Holberton School.
Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg).
Make sure to install HAproxy 1.5 or higher, SSL termination is not available before v1.5.
 2. No loophole in your website traffic
100-redirect_http_to_https contains a HAproxy configuration file.

Info:
A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
Requirements:
This should be transparent to the user.
HAproxy should return a 301.
HAproxy should redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg).
